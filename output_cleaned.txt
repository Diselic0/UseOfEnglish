In the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Union, a green paper is a tentative government report and consultation document of policy proposals for debate and discussionA green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to itGreen papers may result in the production of a white paperThey may be seen as grey literature.


== Canada ==
A green paper in Canada, like a white paper, is an official government documentGreen papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussionThey are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulatedMany white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted legislation.


== United Kingdom ==
Similarly, in the UK, green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside Parliament, for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.The term "green paper" has been said to originate with the publication in 1941 by Herwald Ramsbotham, UK president of the board of education, of plans for educational reform in a green binding, which became known as the "Green Book".


== European Union ==
A green paper released by the European Commission is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topicA green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and informationIt may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.
