the cat (felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammalit is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the familycats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contactdomestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill verminabout 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.the cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and ratsits night vision and sense of smell are well developedcat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body languagealthough the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunteras a predator, it is crepuscular, i.emost active at dawn and duskit can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammalsit also secretes and perceives pheromones.female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittensdomestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancypopulation control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.it was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 bc, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in the near east around 7500 bc.as of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the worldas of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the united states, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one catthe late latin word may be derived from an unidentified african languagethe nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognatesthe nubian word may be a loan from arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.however, it is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient germanic word, imported into latin and thence to greek and to syriac and arabic"the word may be derived from germanic and northern european languages, and ultimately be borrowed from uralic, cfnorthern sami gáđfi, 'female stoat', and hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from proto-uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.the english puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from dutch poes or from low german puuskatte, related to swedish kattepus, or norwegian pus, pusekattsimilar forms exist in lithuanian puižė and irish puisín or puiscínthe etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered)a female is called a queen (or a molly, if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding contexta juvenile cat is referred to as a kittenin early modern english, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catlingfelis catus domesticus was proposed by johann christian polycarp erxleben in 1777felis daemon proposed by konstantin satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.in 2003, the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely felis catus.in 2007, it was considered a subspecies, fsilvestris catus, of the european wildcat (fsilvestris) following results of phylogenetic researchresults of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selectionthe domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genesthe leopard cat (prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in china around 5500 bclybica) was excavated close by a human neolithic grave in shillourokambos, southern cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 bcsince there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on cyprus, the inhabitants of this neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the middle eastern mainlandscientists therefore assume that african wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the fertile crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (mus musculus), and were tamed by neolithic farmersthis mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of yearsas agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated catswildcats of egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.the earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in greece dates to around 1200 bcgreek, phoenician, carthaginian and etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern europeduring the roman empire they were introduced to corsica and sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millenniumby the 5th century bc, they were familiar animals around settlements in magna graecia and etruriaby the end of the western roman empire in the 5th century, the egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a baltic sea port in northern germany.during domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wildseveral natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as petsthese traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligencecaptive leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticatedhouse cats often mate with feral catshybridisation between domestic and other felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the kellas cat in scotland.development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th centuryan analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breedsmost breeds are founded on random-bred domestic catswhen it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and deathcompared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.the premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissorsthese are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.: 37  cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugarin their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe padsthis keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of preythe claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeetcats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more pawsthey may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfacescats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear pawsthe dewclaw is proximal to the other clawsmore proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger"this special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumpingsome cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("polydactyly")it walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible legunlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other sideit registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracksthis also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terraina higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branchanother possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territorya cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.during a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibilitythis reflex is known as the cat righting reflexa cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or morethe domestic cat genes mc1r and asip allow for the variety of color in coatsthe feline asip gene consists of three coding exonslarge pupils are an adaptation to dim lightthe domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberrationat low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyesthe domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limiteda response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of conethis appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic visionit can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 hz to 79 khz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 hz and 20 khzit can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noiseit can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent preycats and many other animals have a jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmeningit allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannotcats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glandsmany cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billionabout 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactonedomestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetnesstheir taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastesdomestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central pointthey establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres)the timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active in the morning and eveninghowever, house cats' behaviour is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent.cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow olderthe daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the averagesome cats can sleep as much as 20 hoursthe term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief periodwithin such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the otherseach cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territoriesthese territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecationbetween these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflictsoutside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacksdespite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animalsethologically, a cat's human keeper functions as if a mother surrogateadult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neotenytheir high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignoresome pet cats are poorly socializedin particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.redirected aggression is a common form of aggression which can occur in multiple cat householdsin redirected aggression there is usually something that agitates the cat: this could be a sight, sound, or another source of stimuli which causes a heightened level of anxiety or arousaltheir body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of moodthe tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in catsa raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostilitytail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate onesferal cats are generally silent.: 208  nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal.post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eatingeven though purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individualsome cats have been observed to purr continuously whenchronically ill or in apparent pain.the exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefullythe cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 500 μm long, which are called papillaethese contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrushsome cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from groomingthese clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) longamong feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a femalein such cases, most fights are won by the heavier maleanother common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small homefemale cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittensneutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.when cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spittingoften, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forwardcats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponentsfights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bitescats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and earsfights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerationsnormally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreatedin addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virussexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nosetherefore, when drinking they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouthslapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward.feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a daythe frequency and size of meals varies between individualsthey select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meatcats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the pastit is also a common misconception that cats like milk/cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milkmost adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrheasome also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coalthis condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents, and are often used as a form of pest controlcats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be capturedthe strategy used depends on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.: 153  domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the united states, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.certain species appear more susceptible than others; in one english village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic catin the recovery of ringed robins (erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (prunella modularis) in britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predationin parts of north america, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety.perhaps the best-known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing and recapturing itthis cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardiansone explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the topanother explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten"this behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill preycats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humansthis behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungryowing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interestthey become habituated to a toy they have played with beforestring is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even deaththey are usually ready to mate between early february and august in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions.several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heatthey fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mateat first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to matethe female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm (1⁄32 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation.after mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughlyif a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks himafter about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeatbecause ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they matefurthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.the morula forms 124 hours after conceptionat 148 hours, early blastocysts format 10–12 days, implantation occursthe gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between may 1998 and october 2000they had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittensthey produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a yearof 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.the first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litterskittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of agequeens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 monthsthis varies depending on breedkittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their motherthey can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproductionthis surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in femalestraditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six monthsin the early 1980s, it was about seven years,: 33  rising to 9.4 years in 1995: 33  and about 15 years in 2021the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseasesdiseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritisit is adaptable and now present on all continents except antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated kerguelen islandsdue to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive speciesit lives on small islands with no human inhabitantsferal cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.the unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofoldon one hand, as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcatthis hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in scotland and hungary, possibly also the iberian peninsula, and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as kruger national park in south africathey are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areasthe numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the united states feral population range from 25 to 60 millionferal cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of foodin nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a "mesopredator release" effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared preydomestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinctionthe south island piopio, chatham rail, and the new zealand merganser are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.one feral cat in new zealand killed 102 new zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven daysin the us, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 – 22.3 billion mammals annually.in australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat lossmore than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 speciescats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day.as well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, stuffed toys, shoes, gloves, and musical instrumentsabout 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coatthis use has been outlawed in the united states since 2000 and in the european union (as well as the united kingdom) since 2007.cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in switzerland as traditional medicine thought to cure rheumatism.a few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the canadian federation of humane societies) and over the internet, but such a task does not seem simple to achievegeneral estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 millionwalter chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the worldit is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated in order to participate in a cat showboth pedigreed and non-purebred companion ("moggy") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organizationin some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the diseasethe same disease can then become evident in a humanthe likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the personhumans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infectedothers might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's bodythe greek historian herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrowsfamilies took their dead cats to the sacred city of bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositoriesherodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.ancient greeks and romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killersthe earliest unmistakable evidence of the greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from magna graecia dating to the mid-fifth century bc showing iokastos and phalanthos, the legendary founders of rhegion and taras respectively, playing with their pet catsthe usual ancient greek word for 'cat' was ailouros, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'cats are rarely mentioned in ancient greek literaturearistotle remarked in his history of animals that "female cats are naturally lecherous." the greeks later syncretized their own goddess artemis with the egyptian goddess bastet, adopting bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to artemisin ovid's metamorphoses, when the deities flee to egypt and take animal forms, the goddess diana turns into a cat.cats eventually displaced weasels as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of miceduring the middle ages, many of artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the virgin marycats are often shown in icons of annunciation and of the holy family and, according to italian folklore, on the same night that mary gave birth to jesus, a cat in bethlehem gave birth to a kittendomestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery, as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humansin japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortunein norse mythology, freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by catsin jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man adam as a pet that got rid of micethe cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animalsit is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the wateralthough no species are sacred in islam, cats are revered by muslimssome western writers have stated muhammad had a favorite cat, muezzahe is reported to have loved cats so much, "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it"the story has no origin in early muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint, ahmed ar-rifa'i, centuries after muhammadan example would be the belief that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's path") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skillsthe killing of cats in medieval ypres, belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day kattenstoet (cat parade)in mid-16th century france, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainmentaccording to norman davies, the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized".james frazer wrote that it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burnedthe people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luckthe french kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own handsin 1648 louis xiv, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hallbut this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in parisat metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the peoplesimilarly, at gap, in the department of the hautes-alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.according to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple livesin many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in italy, germany, greece, brazil and some spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in arabic traditions, the number of lives is sixan early mention of the myth can be found in john heywood's the proverbs of john heywood (1546):husband, (quoth she), ye studie, be merrie now,and even as ye thinke now, so come to yow.nay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right,i thinke how you lay groning, wife, all last night.husband, a groning horse and a groning wifenever faile their master, (quoth she), for my life.no wife, a woman hath nine lives like a cat.the myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situationsalso lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies aroundencyclopedia americana1920.high-resolution images of the cat brainbiodiversity
